# Cybersecurity Home Lab

This repository showcases my cybersecurity home lab projects for the course CPS 593 Cybersecurity, which consist of hands-on experiments, lab exercises, and technical write-ups exploring core security concepts. All projects are built and tested in isolated environments using virtual machines, Docker, and other lab configurations to safely simulate attacks, implement defensive strategies, and analyze system behavior without impacting production systems.
